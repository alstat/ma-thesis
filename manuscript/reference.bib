It endorses the possibility of discerning relationships of temporal priority and posteriority between different Qur’anic proclamations and addresses various objections raised against a diachronic approach to the Qur’an. Particular attention is paid to the striking convergences that can be detected between suras’ mean verse length and other terminological, literary, and thematic features displayed by them. It is argued that the traditional hypothesis that the Qur’anic proclamations can be arranged in a linear series of successive texts or textual clusters provides a compelling explanation for such convergences.},

In this investigation, we try to make an author discrimination between the Quran (The holy words and statements of God in the Islamic religion) and the Hadith (statements said by the prophet Muhammad). The Quran is taken in its entirety, whereas for the Prophet’s statements, we chose only the certified texts of the Bukhari book. Thus, three series of experiments are done and commented on. The first series of experiments analyses the two books in a global form (the text of every book is analyzed as a unique big text). It concerns nine different experiments. The second series of experiments analyses the two books in a segmental form (four different segments of text are extracted from every book). It concerns five different experiments. The third series of experiments makes an automatic authorship attribution of the two books in a segmental form by employing several classifiers and several types of features. The sizes of the segments are more or less in the same range (four different text segments, with approximately the same size, are extracted from every book). It concerns two different experiments. This investigation sheds light on an old enigma, which has not been solved for 14 centuries: in fact, all the results of this investigation have shown that the two books should have two different authors.}",

Given these limitations, Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like Sentiment Analysis (SA), Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Question Answering (QA), have proven to be very challenging to tackle. Recently, with the surge of transformers based models, language-specific BERT based models have proven to be very efficient at language understanding, provided they are pre-trained on a very large corpus. Such models were able to set new standards and achieve state-of-the-art results for most NLP tasks. In this paper, we pre-trained BERT specifically for the Arabic language in the pursuit of achieving the same success that BERT did for the English language. The performance of AraBERT is compared to multilingual BERT from Google and other state-of-the-art approaches. The results showed that the newly developed AraBERT achieved state-of-the-art performance on most tested Arabic NLP tasks. The pretrained araBERT models are publicly available on \url{https://github.com/aub-mind/araBERT} hoping to encourage research and applications for Arabic NLP."

We construct QRCD as the first Qur’anic Reading Comprehension Dataset, composed of 1,337 question-passage-answer triplets for 1,093 question-passage pairs, of which 14% are multi-answer questions. We then introduce CLassical-AraBERT (CL-AraBERT for short), a new AraBERT-based pre-trained model, which is further pre-trained on about 1.0B-word Classical Arabic (CA) dataset, to complement the Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) resources used in pre-training the initial model, and make it a better fit for the task. Finally, we leverage cross-lingual transfer learning from MSA to CA, and fine-tune CL-AraBERT as a reader using two MSA-based MRC datasets followed by our QRCD dataset to constitute the first (to the best of our knowledge) MRC system on the Holy Qur’an. To evaluate our system, we introduce Partial Average Precision (pAP) as an adapted version of the traditional rank-based Average Precision measure, which integrates partial matching in the evaluation over multi-answer and single-answer MSA questions. Adopting two experimental evaluation setups (hold-out and cross validation (CV)), we empirically show that the fine-tuned CL-AraBERT reader model significantly outperforms the baseline fine-tuned AraBERT reader model by 6.12 and 3.75 points in pAP scores, in the hold-out and CV setups, respectively. To promote further research on this task and other related tasks on Qur’an and Classical Arabic text, we make both the QRCD dataset and the pre-trained CL-AraBERT model publicly available.}

	abstract = {Semantic similarity analysis in natural language texts is getting great attention recently. Semantic analysis of the Quran is especially challenging because it is not simply factual but encodes subtle religious meanings. Investigating similarity and relatedness between the Quranic verses is a hot topic and can promote the acquisition of the underlying knowledge. Therefore, we use an NPL method to detect the semantic-based similarity between the verses of the Quran. The idea is to exploit the distributed representation of text, to learn an informative representation of the Quran's passages. We map the Arabic Quranic verses to numerical vectors that encode the semantic properties of the text. We then measure similarity among those vectors. The performance of our model is judged through cosine similarity between our assigned semantic similarity scores and annotated textual similarity datasets. Our model scored 76% accuracy on detecting the similarity, and it can act as a basis for potential experiments and research.},

@article{MANNAA20228909,
	abstract = {The end-case analysis of Arabic sentences is one of the keys to their meaning. This process is called i`raab, a daunting task for the students. The outcome of the analysis is twofold: (a) placing a proper diacritical marking on the end-cases of individual words, and (b) providing a logical justification. Our objective is to generate a full i`raabof the sentences, which could be incorporated in a computer-assisted Arabic grammar learning environment, teaching and helping the students with the i`raabprocess. Our system comprises four components that work together to generate a proper i`raabfor the sentence. We devise an enhanced context-free grammar (eCFG) that covers all the cases and rules taught in Saudi schools' grammar textbooks (grades 7--12). Moreover, our eCFGgrammar eliminates the need for specialized grammars, e.g., head-driven phrase structure grammar and link grammar, to resolve complex cases involving dependencies. Furthermore, we utilize ontology to determine the correct semantics. The system was tested on 300 sentences varying in complexity from the Arabic grammar textbooks used in the schools. Our system achieved an overall accuracy of 88.33%.},

@article{ELAFFENDI202135,
	abstract = {This paper describes how a simple novel Galois Power-of-Two (GPOW2) real-time embedding scheme is used to improve the performance and accuracy of downstream NLP tasks. GPOW2 computes embeddings live on the fly (real time) in the context of target NLP tasks without the need for tabulated pre-embeddings. One excellent feature of the method is the ability to capture multilevel embeddings in the same pass. It simultaneously computes character, word and sentence embeddings on the fly. GPOW2 has been derived in the context of attempts to improve the performance of the SWAM Arabic morphological engine, which is a multipurpose tool that supports segmentation, classification, POS tagging, spell checking, word embeddings, sematic search, among other tasks. SWAM is a pattern-oriented algorithm that relies on morphological patterns and POS tagging to perform NLP tasks. The paper demonstrates how GPOW2 led to improvements in the accuracy of POS tagging and pattern matching, and accordingly the performance of the whole engine. The accuracy for pattern prediction is 99.47% and is 98.80% for POS tagging.},

This corpus will be a valuable evaluation resource for computational linguists investigating similarity and relatedness in short texts. Furthermore, this dataset can be used for evaluation of paraphrase analysis and machine translation tasks. Our dataset is characterised by: (1) superior quality of relatedness assignment; as we have incorporated relations marked by well-known domain experts, this dataset could thus be considered a gold standard corpus for various evaluation tasks, (2) the size of our dataset; over 7,600 pairs of related verses are collected from scholarly sources with several levels of degree of relatedness. This dataset could be extended to over 13,500 pairs of related verses observing the commutative property of strongly related pairs. This dataset was incorporated into online query pages where users can visualize for a given verse a network of all directly and indirectly related verses. Empirical experiments showed that only 33{\%} of related pairs shared root words, emphasising the need to go beyond common lexical matching methods, and incorporate -in addition- semantic, domain knowledge, and other corpus-based approaches.}

We have shown useful applications of this corpus. This corpus is first of its kind considering classical Arabic text, which could be used for interesting applications for Modern Standard Arabic as well. This corpus would benefit researchers in obtaining empirical and rules in building new anaphora resolution approaches. Also, such corpus would be used to train, optimize and evaluate existing approaches.}

This idea is applied to the discovery of thematic interrelationships among the suras (chapters) of the Qur'an by abstracting lexical frequency data from them and then applying hierarchical cluster analysis to that data. The results reported here indicate that the proposed methodology yields usable results in understanding the Qur'an on the basis of its lexical semantics.},

  abstract  = {The Quranic Arabic Corpus (\url{http://corpus.quran.com}) is an annotated linguistic resource with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar. The motivation behind this work is to produce a resource that enables further analysis of the Quran, the 1,400 year old central religious text of Islam. This paper describes a new approach to morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic, a genre difficult to compare with other forms of Arabic. Processing Quranic Arabic is a unique challenge from a computational point of view, since the vocabulary and spelling differ from Modern Standard Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus differs from other Arabic computational resources in adopting a tagset that closely follows traditional Arabic grammar. We made this decision in order to leverage a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, and to encourage online collaborative annotation. In this paper, we discuss how the unique challenge of morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic is solved using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic morphological tagging using diacritic edit-distance, two-pass manual verification, and online collaborative annotation. This process is evaluated to validate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology.}

  abstract  = {QuranTree.jl is an open-source package for working with the Quranic Arabic Corpus (Dukes and Habash, 2010). It aims to provide Julia APIs as an alternative to the Java APIs of JQuranTree. QuranTree.jl currently offers functionalities for intuitive indexing of chapters, verses, words and parts of words of the Qur{'}an; for creating custom transliteration; for character dediacritization and normalization; and, for handling the morphological features. Lastly, it can work well with Julia{'}s TextAnalysis.jl and Python{'}s CAMeL Tools.}
