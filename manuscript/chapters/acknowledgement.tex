}\textit{Many times I thought about turning this into a simple research paper just to meet the course requirements. But each time I study the Qur'\=an, calling it inspiring or motivating feels like an understatement. I've never encountered a book crafted with such beauty in all aspects of literature. Some might see me as biased, but any sincere researcher who approaches the text without prejudice would confirm this truth, and this paper aims to showcase some of this beauty. With that, I want to thank first and foremost Allah \textrm{\txarb{\fontspec{Scheherazade New} ï·¾}} for giving me the chance to study the Qur'\=an, a journey that will continue for the rest of my life.}\\[0.3cm]

Wadi, for his patience, guidance, and for introducing me to the field of Qur'\=anic studies and Islamic Philosophy, my two favorite subjects in the course; my examiners, Atty. Mehol Sadain, for his critical review that helped polish the paper, and Dr. Joselito C. Magadia (from UPD School of Statistics), who was my thesis adviser for my MSc. in Statistics before, for his support and critical review of the mathematical aspects of this thesis, and for providing me other related articles on rhythmic analysis.
