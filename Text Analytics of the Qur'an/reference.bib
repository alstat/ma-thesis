  abstract  = {This paper presents a large corpus created from the original Quranic text, where semantically similar or related verses are linked together. This corpus will be a valuable evaluation resource for computational linguists investigating similarity and relatedness in short texts. Furthermore, this dataset can be used for evaluation of paraphrase analysis and machine translation tasks. Our dataset is characterised by: (1) superior quality of relatedness assignment; as we have incorporated relations marked by well-known domain experts, this dataset could thus be considered a gold standard corpus for various evaluation tasks, (2) the size of our dataset; over 7,600 pairs of related verses are collected from scholarly sources with several levels of degree of relatedness. This dataset could be extended to over 13,500 pairs of related verses observing the commutative property of strongly related pairs. This dataset was incorporated into online query pages where users can visualize for a given verse a network of all directly and indirectly related verses. Empirical experiments showed that only 33{\%} of related pairs shared root words, emphasising the need to go beyond common lexical matching methods, and incorporate -in addition- semantic, domain knowledge, and other corpus-based approaches.}

  abstract  = {This paper presents QurAna: a large corpus created from the original Quranic text, where personal pronouns are tagged with their antecedence. These antecedents are maintained as an ontological list of concepts, which have proved helpful for information retrieval tasks. QurAna is characterized by: (a) comparatively large number of pronouns tagged with antecedent information (over 24,500 pronouns), and (b) maintenance of an ontological concept list out of these antecedents. We have shown useful applications of this corpus. This corpus is first of its kind considering classical Arabic text, which could be used for interesting applications for Modern Standard Arabic as well. This corpus would benefit researchers in obtaining empirical and rules in building new anaphora resolution approaches. Also, such corpus would be used to train, optimize and evaluate existing approaches.}

This idea is applied to the discovery of thematic interrelationships among the suras (chapters) of the Qur'an by abstracting lexical frequency data from them and then applying hierarchical cluster analysis to that data. The results reported here indicate that the proposed methodology yields usable results in understanding the Qur'an on the basis of its lexical semantics.},

  abstract  = {The Quranic Arabic Corpus (\url{http://corpus.quran.com}) is an annotated linguistic resource with multiple layers of annotation including morphological segmentation, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic analysis using dependency grammar. The motivation behind this work is to produce a resource that enables further analysis of the Quran, the 1,400 year old central religious text of Islam. This paper describes a new approach to morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic, a genre difficult to compare with other forms of Arabic. Processing Quranic Arabic is a unique challenge from a computational point of view, since the vocabulary and spelling differ from Modern Standard Arabic. The Quranic Arabic Corpus differs from other Arabic computational resources in adopting a tagset that closely follows traditional Arabic grammar. We made this decision in order to leverage a large body of existing historical grammatical analysis, and to encourage online collaborative annotation. In this paper, we discuss how the unique challenge of morphological annotation of Quranic Arabic is solved using a multi-stage approach. The different stages include automatic morphological tagging using diacritic edit-distance, two-pass manual verification, and online collaborative annotation. This process is evaluated to validate the appropriateness of the chosen methodology.}
